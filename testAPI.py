It's about a week's walk from here.<br>**EISEN**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's that far away?<br>**HIMMEL**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unbelievable.<br>**HIMMEL**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You should be kinder to the elderly.<br>**HIMMEL**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings back memories.<br>**HIMMEL**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traveling together like this makes me<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;feel like we've returned to those days.<br>**HIMMEL**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We journeyed to all sorts of places.<br>**HIMMEL**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything seemed so brilliant and new.<br>**HIMMEL**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you were always there<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in those beautiful memories.<br>**HIMMEL**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd been looking forward to the day<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when we'd all be together again.<br>**HIMMEL**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Frieren.<br>**HIMMEL**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of you, I had this delightful<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;adventure at the very end.<br>**HIMMEL**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They're beautiful.<br>**HEITER**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Himmel was happy.<br>**FRIEREN**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You think so?<br>**ATTENDANT A**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was one of Mr. Himmel's companions?<br>**ATTENDANT A**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I haven't seen her look sad once today.<br>**ATTENDANT B**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How heartless.<br>**HEITER**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, now!

Then I have another request.<br>**HEITER**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was unearthed from<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the tomb of Ewig the Sage.<br>**HEITER**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This grimoire is said to contain lost<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spells of resurrection and immortality.<br>**FRIEREN**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it hard to believe<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;such magic really exists.<br>**HEITER**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's part of why I'd like you to decipher it.<br>**HEITER**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you do that?<br>**FRIEREN**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's written in code using pictures.<br>**FRIEREN**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of this era<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;really liked this kind of thing.<br>**FRIEREN**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could do it, given five or six years.<br>**HEITER**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see.<br>**FRIEREN**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But why do you want this deciphered?<br>**FRIEREN**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought you weren't afraid of dying.<br>**HEITER**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have two reasons.<br>**HEITER**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is that I when I said that,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was just putting on a brave face for you.<br>**HEITER**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is that I'm now more<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;afraid of dying than I was before.<br>**HEITER**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if I can't achieve immortality,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd like a bit more time.<br>**HEITER**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, the holy texts tell us<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to live healthy lives.<br>**HEITER**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A long life is the ultimate<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;expression of that, Frieren.<br>**FRIEREN**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You corrupt priest.<br>**HEITER**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, in your spare time,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will you teach Fern magic?<br>**HEITER**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a priest, I don't have that knowledge.<br>**FRIEREN**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could do that.<br>**FRIEREN**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There you are.<br>**FRIEREN**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've been looking everywhere for you.<br>**FRIEREN**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you always train in the woods?<br>**FERN**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was finding me difficult even for you?<br>**FERN**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Heiter often tells me<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm practically invisible.<br>**FERN**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's a very good thing, isn't it?<br>**FRIEREN**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is.<br>**FRIEREN**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*It's true.
