"And you alright<br>Can you hear me<br>Trailing along deserted train tracks<br>Crying excessively<br>Wanting you to smile<br>I hold on to memories I'd like to keep fresh<br>There's something I'd like to tell you<br>With words more precious than a goodbye<br>Unremarkable yet special<br>See, things that couldn't have been<br>Seen if it weren't for these eyes<br>Why? They begin to overflow<br>So, if I were to be born again<br>I would surely choose this place once more<br>So, if we were to meet again<br>I'd never let you go, I'd choose the present<br>Even if no promises were made<br>Even if I'm lost in days of loneliness<br>Those tears will be alright, \\Ndawn will surely break<br>I\u2019m whispering our lullaby<br>for you to come back home"
