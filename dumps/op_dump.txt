"Like a fairy tale<br>It's a sign the story has reached its end<br>Like a single passage taken from<br>A journey that was too long<br>Of the evil that once cast a shadow<br>Across this land<br>And the memories of the short journey<br>With the hero who defeated it<br>The story ends<br>And the hero goes to sleep<br>Leaving this land with<br>Days of peace and quiet<br>The passage of time heartlessly<br>Makes people forget<br>Even the tracks left behind by his life<br>Begin to rust<br>Just the same<br>Your words and wishes and courage<br>Are still inside of me<br>And they live on<br>We chose the same path<br>That's all it was supposed to be<br>Why is it that at some point<br>I wanted to understand the reason for<br>The tears that fall down my cheeks<br>Even now<br>If I retrace the journey we walked together<br>Even though you're not there<br>I know I'll be able to find it"
