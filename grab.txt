Sosuke Kaburaya is a detective struggling to make ends meet. While on a case, he happens upon Sara da Odin, a princess from another world who wields magical powers. Sara quickly adjusts to modern Japanese life as Livia de Udis, a knight from Sara’s kingdom, arrives to find her. Soon enough, both Sara and Livia’s positivity begins to rub off on Sosuke and the neighborhood’s cast of characters.
