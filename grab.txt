What if your life hung in the balance of a twisted game? A self-proclaimed “Emperor” has gathered five young people through anonymous messages and asks, “Do you want to live?” But the game only has one rule: “Majority dies.” Saneatsu and Saaya, among the five trapped individuals, unite to defeat the Emperor and end the game once and for all.
