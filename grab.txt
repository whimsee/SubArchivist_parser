[[
Allen is banished from the Duchy of Westfeldt on account of his low level and lack of a god-given Gift, and all seems lost. But with his memories of a past life as a hero intact, Allen sees this twist of fate as a blessing—he can finally live his life as he pleases! That momentary peace is cut short when Allen saves his ex-fiancée, beginning a new saga for the banished former hero.
