Kaiju No. 8 is one of the most popular serialized manga published on Shonen Jump+ in recent yearsâ€”a refreshing blend of action, comedy, and adventure. While readers initially drew connections between Kaiju No. 8 and series like Attack on Titan, Chainsaw Man, and One-Punch Man, fans soon fell in love with its unique elements, art style, and protagonist. The manga quickly became a global sensation. In the first six months, over 550,000 copies were in circulation. By March 2023, over 11 million copies were in circulation. When the Production I.G animation studio announced they were developing an anime series under the supervision of Studio khara, fans anxiously awaited to see the series adapted for the screen.

The story revolves around Kafka Hibino, a 32-year-old longing to join The Defense Force and make good on his promise to a childhood friend, Mina Ashiro. He befriends a new coworker Reno Ichikawa, while cleaning up Kaiju remains, whose determination to join The Defense Force inspires Kafka to fulfill his childhood promise to pass the entrance exam and join Mina to protect humanity. When a small Kaiju burrows itself inside Kafka, he gains superhuman strength and powers fit for fighting Kaiju. He works to earn the trust of his human teammates, defeat increasingly powerful Kaiju, and keep the world safe.
