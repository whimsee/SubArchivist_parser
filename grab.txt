Lu Mingfei is a typical high school kid getting ready to graduate. That is, until he receives an acceptance letter from Cassell College, a school he didn’t even apply to. Upon arrival, Lu learns that the school’s mission is simple: protect humanity from dragons. Caught in the midst of the age-old conflict, Lu soon uncovers the grim truth behind humanity’s war against the dragon race.
