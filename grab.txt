her maker, she’s reborn with an adorable ability.
Midori is reincarnated in another world as a young girl,
Nema, and must help decide if the humans there should continue to exist. In return, she gains the power to be loved by all nonhuman creatures. From fantasy beasts to mythical monsters, she’s free to pet any animal to her heart’s content!
